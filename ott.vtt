1
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.888
This is a story...

2
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.768
a story of a very special boy...

3
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.442
...who found himself
at the end of the world.

4
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.279
But our story doesn't begin here.

5
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.489
We have to go back...

6
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.410
...before the Great Crumble.

7
00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.746
- Don't forget...
- The turkey, I know.

8
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.622
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

9
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.250
Because it's also the story of a doctor

10
00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.211
who was happy living a normal life.

11
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.340
So what you're telling me is that
your crocodile's name is Croc.

12
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.092
That's a great name for a crocodile.

13
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.178
We're gonna have you
out of here in no time,

14
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.014
and get you to enjoy
this lovely weather we're having.

15
00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:58.349
This is the third-best doctor here,
aren't you? Joking.

16
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.727
We're gonna take your temperature.

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.188
Tell me about your symptoms,
when you first...

18
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:09.238
Let's meet the Guardians' defense.

19
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.821
- Ugh! Damn it.
- Starting with its captain.

20
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:12.947
You forgot, didn't you?

21
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.407
I'll get it tomorrow.

22
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:20.455
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

23
00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:21.998
Enjoy your lollipop.

24
00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.334
We'll see you later.

25
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.587
But there was nothing normal
about the Sick.

26
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.671
Come on.

27
00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.388
And life would never be normal again.

28
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.140
How long did this take?

29
00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.892
She was fine three days ago.

30
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.690
Get the room sealed.

31
00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:53.238
We're anticipating
numbers not seen since the Black Plague.

32
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:58.284
The H5G9 strain is now officially
the deadliest virus in our lifetime.

33
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.286
It is here, it is now.

34
00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.706
If you don't pray,
now's a good time to start.

35
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.711
But while the doctor
faced the horrors of the city,

36
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.799
a father was escaping to the wilderness...

37
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.345
to leave the world behind.

38
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.145
Rani?

39
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.608
Rani?

40
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.319
Rani!

41
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.156
Rani?

42
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.125
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.838
Come on, now. We'll go to the car, okay?

44
00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.268
Anyone leaving is...

45
00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.983
No, no, no, no, no, no!

46
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.746
Get back here!

47
00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.821
We're all right. Hold my hand.
Hold my hand. I love you, okay?

48
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:17.906
I love you.

49
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.912
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.084
Emergency curfew is now in effect.

51
00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.841
Hey! Hey!

52
00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:42.972
Out the way!

53
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.182
Out the way!

54
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.018
Move! Move out the way!

55
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.770
Get out of the way!

56
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.146
Move!

57
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.982
You're okay. Shh. You're okay.

58
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.402
Okay. Shh. You're okay.

59
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.614
Shh. Shh.

60
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:02.867
Oh God!

61
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:06.246
But this,
this wasn't the end of their story.

62
00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.049
Excuse me, are you a doctor?

63
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:23.805
Yeah.

64
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.473
I think I need your help.

65
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.942
It just started this morning.

66
00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:47.495
You see, as the world slipped into chaos,

67
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.999
something else was happening.

68
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.086
Something... extraordinary.

69
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.567
No one knew which came first...

70
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.321
the hybrids or the virus.

71
00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:27.368
But that question would become
the biggest mystery of our lifetime.

72
00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:36.294
This is a story about a very special boy...

73
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.424
a boy by the name of Gus.

74
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.810
Some stories start at the beginning.

75
00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.689
Ours begins here.

76
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.359
What the...

77
00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.965
They're being called hybrids,

78
00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.165
unexplained phenomenon
of animal-human babies being born...

79
00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.143
- Part animal.
- Part human.

80
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.270
What came first, the virus or the hybrids?

81
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.922
That's been the greatest mystery
of the 21st century.

82
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:23.442
Biologists are
still searching for any connection

83
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.176
between the hybrids and H5G9 virus.

84
00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.654
Parents are pushing back on
hospitals over the new law

85
00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:28.888
requiring hybrid testing.

Ah!

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.230
Yeah!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.265
What'd you say?

100
00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:55.932

You Gus, me Pubba.

102
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.110
Happy birthday! Okay, open this thing up.

103
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.197
Let's see what we got.
What do you think it is?

104
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.281
Books.

105
00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:11.866
Yeah. Let's see...

106
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.621
Wait for it.

107
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.874
- You're gonna scare the fish.
- No, I'm not.

108
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.919
- If I hear a growl...
- I will duck.

109
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.755
If I hear a voice...

110
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.215
I will run.

111
00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:29.759
If I see a human?

112
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.511
I will hide.

113
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:34.889
You'll get it.

114
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.098
All right.

115
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.183
Try again.

116
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.523
- No!
- Here I go!

117
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.691
Ah!

118
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.027
- You know how humans have blood?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.153
Trees have sap.

120
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:52.240
Be careful, it's gonna be hot.

121
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:03.501
All right.

122
00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:06.212
This'll be loud for you, buddy.
Let's cover your ears.

123
00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:07.296
It's a bird.

124
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.006
It's a big, big bird. Okay?

125
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.224
All right, it's all right.

126
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.188
As much as the father tried
to keep the dangers of the world out...

127
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.569
the outside world
had a way of sneaking in.

128
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:34.824
All right.

129
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.827
From now on, no more fires during the day.

130
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.245
It's too dangerous.

131
00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.748
Yeah!

132
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.542
I worked very hard on this.

133
00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.462
- A dog!
- Yeah, it's a dog.

134
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:50.464
So what do you want to name it?

135
00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.466
I'll name him...

136
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.468
Dog.

137
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.471
You know,
that's the perfect name for a dog. Yeah.

138
00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.932
"'Oh, shucks, baby."

139
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.202
"You want to see your mother, I reckon.'

140
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:05.229
'Yes, I... '"

141
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.744
Pubba!

142
00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.790
Pubba!

143
00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:08.334
Pubba!

144
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.877
Hey, I'm here.

145
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960
I got you.

146
00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.343
It's just Mother Nature, Gus,
washing her world clean.

147
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.290
Can we live on a raft
in the river, like Huck?

148
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:52.211
There are no rivers inside the fence,
Gus, you know that.

149
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.255
What about out there?

150
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.883
Well, I told you we can't go out there.

151
00:11:58.968 --> 00:11:59.844
Why not?

152
00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:01.137
Because I said so.

153
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.266
You said when I'm old enough,
you'll tell me.

154
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:06.684
I know what I said.

155
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:10.812
So?

156
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:13.815
So what?

157
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.319
I'm seven. So?

158
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.089
Once upon a time,

159
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.383
bad people ruled the Earth.

160
00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.096
Doing what they wanted,
taking from the planet.

161
00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:46.724
Just like those ants.

162
00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.935
They were greedy things,

163
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:52.313
self-destructive,

164
00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:54.690
only out for themselves.

165
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.569
So Nature made everyone sick,

166
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.614
and wiped away as many as she could.

167
00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.909
And then a miracle happened.

168
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:06.952
Your kind.

169
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.789
They called them hybrids.

170
00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:14.210
No one knows where you came from or how.

171
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.172
But the people who were left feared you.

172
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.803
They were meaner now, angrier.

173
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.972
They didn't like you
because you were different.

174
00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:31.477
So Nature set
the rest of the Earth on fire.

175
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:35.815
And now it burns forever.

176
00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:39.819
But some bad people
are still out there, Gus,

177
00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.696
in the flames, waiting.

178
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.034
It's my job
to make sure they never get in.

179
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:51.247
And it's your job

180
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.915
to live a full life,

181
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.252
and to be happy, to be kind.

182
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.003
I saw her today.

183
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:01.924
Who?

184
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.007
Mama.

185
00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:06.554
She was pretty,
but she didn't have nubbins like me.

186
00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.598
Yeah, that wasn't your mother, Gus.

187
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.600
How do you know?

188
00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:17.565
'Cause your mother's gone, Gus.

189
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.191
That's how I know.

190
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.963
That night, the father decided
that some of the boy's questions...

191
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.343
were just too hard to answer.

192
00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:37.519
Happy birthday.

193
00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.481
Wow.

194
00:15:42.858 --> 00:15:43.858
What is it?

195
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.569
You'll figure it out.

196
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.282
Ow!

197
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.205
Is that gift a mistake?

198
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.807
Mama.

199
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.421
Growl...

200
00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:30.339
duck.

201
00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:38.432
What did I tell you?!

202
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.350
What did I tell you?

203
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.810
What did I tell you?

204
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.937
Someone could have seen you!

205
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.314
I heard something!

206
00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.566
- What did I tell you?!
- I thought it was her!

207
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.860
I told you, she's gone!

208
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.405
It's my fault.
I told you not to be afraid.

209
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.782
I thought I could trust you.

210
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:55.866
You can!

211
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:57.910
No, we need to trust each other!

212
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:01.413
I don't trust you. You don't tell me
everything. You think I'm too little!

213
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:03.874
You are too little, Gus.

214
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.919
And you just proved it.

215
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.396
Sarah?

216
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:33.570
Hello?

217
00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:35.447
Oh, no. All right.

218
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.291
Sarah!

219
00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:49.545
Sarah?

220
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.212
Sarah?

221
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.925
Hey! Don't come any closer!

222
00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:57.427
Afternoon.

223
00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:01.098
You mind lowering the gun?

224
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.351
Feel better if I didn't.

225
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.603
I'm just looking for someone.

226
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.313
Well, they're not here.

227
00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.065
You better look someplace else.

228
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:13.277
How long you been here?

229
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:16.989
I realize how this looks,
but I give you my word,

230
00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:18.699
I had no idea your camp was here.

231
00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.325
Who said I had a camp?

232
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.581
My sister went off in these mountains,

233
00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.249
a week and a half ago.

234
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.252
- It's not a place for an unarmed woman.
- Don't move.

235
00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.337
I want to know if she made it through.

236
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.256
She didn't come through here.

237
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:38.385
You should get back on the road
before it gets dark.

238
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.723
The road's the last place
you want to be, friend.

239
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.768
You haven't gotten out much lately, huh?

240
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:53.942
What's it like out there?

241
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.028
It sucks.

242
00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.199
No rules, no laws.

243
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.785
Once the Internet went down, it was over.

244
00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:06.872
Just tribes of people, scared.

245
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.167
Fighting over whatever's left.

246
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:13.419
What about the Sick?

247
00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.465
It slowed down,

248
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.550
but it's still out there.

249
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:22.596
- People think the hybrids caused it.
- Yeah, well, maybe it caused them.

250
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:23.680
Yeah, maybe.

251
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.975
Any case, ain't many of us left.

252
00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:31.146
So if you're out here alone,

253
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.106
isolated and whatnot...

254
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.361
you probably aren't in a company.

255
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.487
Are you?

256
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.740
In a company?

257
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:45.702
Alone.

258
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:49.957
I've lived here alone by myself

259
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.751
for nine years and... and 17 weeks

260
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:55.003
and... three days!

261
00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.926
Hey!

262
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.761
Hey!

263
00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.221
Hey!

264
00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.474
Hey, where'd you go?

265
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:09.518
Stay back! Stay back!

266
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.102
Hey!

267
00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:17.484
He marked us.

268
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.614
- Gus, son, get in.
- I don't wanna.

269
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.408
I said, get in the cubby.

270
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.285
- It's a hole.
- It's not a hole.

271
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:30.956
You know how foxes hide out during the day
in their little fox house in the ground?

272
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.418
What's the Sick?

273
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:35.501
It's, uh...

274
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.754
grownup stuff.

275
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.673
Why'd you say you lived alone?

276
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.382
To protect you.

277
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:45.721
Sometimes it's okay to bend the truth
if it helps someone you love.

278
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:47.806
Understand?

279
00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.308
I'm scared.

280
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:51.935
I know, but I promise you,

281
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.604
if you hide in that cubby
and you be very quiet,

282
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:56.815
I'll be back before the sun goes to bed.

283
00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.486
You can take your syrup.

284
00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.742
Remember what I said.

285
00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.160
It's okay to lie?

286
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.454
That's what you took
from that conversation?

287
00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:12.789
No, I said don't come out
until you hear from me.

288
00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:14.583
I love you, Gus.

289
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.085
And you're not too little.

290
00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.962
Stay big for me.

291
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:40.543
Mama.

292
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.194
No!

293
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.355
Pubba. Pubba!

294
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:45.734
Pubba, what took you so long?

295
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.112
I heard a scream.

296
00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.197
I know.

297
00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:53.283
I didn't like it.

298
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.410
But you're safe.

299
00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:57.704
You're safe now.

300
00:24:57.787 --> 00:24:59.331
He won't hurt you.

301
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.210
Pubba!

302
00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.669
Wake up. Pubba!

303
00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:06.755
Pubba?

304
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.339
Pubba?

305
00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:09.883
Pubba! Pubba!

306
00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:11.343
Wake up, Pubba.

307
00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.632
I was doing the right thing.

308
00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.376
I was doing the right thing.

309
00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:47.295
There's a good boy.

310
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:51.967
You did the right thing.
You did the right thing.

311
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:19.035
You did this?

312
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.249
Your mother...

313
00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:27.586
She was like me, Gus.

314
00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:30.922
Or she was better than me.

315
00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.801
She would be so proud of you.

316
00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:39.598
You were her joy.

317
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:41.641
You were her life.

318
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:43.852
You always will be.

319
00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.450
What happened?

320
00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:01.244
Life.

321
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:03.997
We were separated.

322
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.708
So I brought you here.

323
00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.419
What was her name?

324
00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:12.213
Birdie.

325
00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:15.175
Yeah. Her name was Birdie.

326
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:20.472
When you get better, we can look for her.

327
00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:22.766
If I hear a growl...

328
00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:26.061
I will duck.

329
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.646
If I hear a voice...

330
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:28.813
I will run.

331
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.065
If I see a human...

332
00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.524
- I will hide.
- Okay.

333
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.068
What don't we do?

334
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.278
- Cross the fence.
- Ever.

335
00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.323
- Never ever.
- Okay, promise me, Gus.

336
00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:41.660
Pinky swear.

337
00:27:47.957 --> 00:27:48.957
Hey.

338
00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:51.795
I'm the luckiest dad in the world.

339
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:53.505
You know why?

340
00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.884
Because I got to spend the last nine years

341
00:27:58.468 --> 00:28:01.054
with a very, very special boy.

342
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:04.307
You.

343
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.810
In a world we got to build together.

344
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.522
I couldn't ask for anything else.

345
00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.612
I'm tired.

346
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:21.032
You know what could
wake me up, though?

347
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:25.078
Breakfast. Will you go make us some?

348
00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:27.956
But you make the breakfast.

349
00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.542
And you watch me, so you know how, okay?

350
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:32.460
What do we start with?

351
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:35.587
A plate.

352
00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:37.172
What food?

353
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:39.968
Eggs.

354
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:41.594
Yeah. See that?

355
00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:46.224
Then you'll tell me more?

356
00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:49.893
Yeah.

357
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.604
Yeah, I'll tell you...

358
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:53.648
everything.

359
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:02.532
Hello, ducks.

360
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.972
Pubba! Pubba!

361
00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.055
I did it!

362
00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:28.724
I crossed...

363
00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:36.524
Pubba?

364
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:51.747
Pubba?

365
00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.724
By his tenth winter,

366
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.644
the boy was now the man of the house.

367
00:30:58.147 --> 00:30:59.649
With hard work

368
00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:01.067
came harder play.

369
00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:02.527
He, hoo...

370
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.612
As his antlers grew...

371
00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:09.200
so did his imagination.

372
00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:15.331
You should have saw it.
Bad people were everywhere.

373
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:19.752
I thought they was gonna take me and Dog,
but Dog scared them away for good,

374
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:21.004
didn't you, Dog?

375
00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:32.307
Sometimes all a boy has
is his imagination.

376
00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.144
Rabbit, you're on garden duty.

377
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.439
Goat, you need
to keep the birds off the peas.

378
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:40.982
We can't lose any more.

379
00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:43.401
And me and Dog
will do the syrup and the water.

380
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:44.319
And remember,

381
00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:47.780
do not cross the fence.

382
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:49.781
Now go.

383
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.710
Yes!

384
00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:09.676
No!

385
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:42.752
Stupid weeds.

386
00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.477
Stupid weasel thing!

387
00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:04.983
Dumb goat!

388
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.072
You!

389
00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.685
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

390
00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:19.766
Pubba.

391
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:07.814
Hmm.

392
00:36:04.787 --> 00:36:06.455
Colorado.

393
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.855
I'm coming for you, Birdie.

394
00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:56.208
Hide. If I see a human, I will hide.

395
00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:58.627
If I see a human, I will hide.

396
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:01.047
- Come on, buddy.
- If I see a human, I will hide.

397
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.173
I seen ya.

398
00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:06.093
Show yourself. You like that candy?

399
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:08.387
When you poke your little head out,

400
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.557
and I'll put one right between your eyes.

401
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.476
Come on.

402
00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:14.643
Come on.

403
00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.522
I got him! Have a look!

404
00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:20.107
- I told you!
- I got him!

405
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.984
What did I tell you?

406
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:25.529
- I ain't ever seen a deer one afore.
- Yeah, me neither.

407
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.158
He's got a little shirt and everything.

408
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:32.161
Yeah. Hey, don't he look
bigger than the others?

409
00:39:33.287 --> 00:39:35.414
Yeah, older too.

410
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.209
You thinking what I'm thinking?

411
00:39:39.418 --> 00:39:41.087
We take it to the lab?

412
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.671
No, no, no, no, no.

413
00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:44.757
We bring him east.

414
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.717
This one's too special.

415
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.844
Yeah.

416
00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:49.845
Let me go!

417
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.015
Oh, did you hear that?

418
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:54.099
It talked.

419
00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.185
I got you.

420
00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:17.790
Ah!

421
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:44.108
Hey... hello.

422
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:45.191
Um...

423
00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:48.779
We could share. Huh?

424
00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:52.032
Hey! No, no, no, no, no.

425
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.868
Mm... Okay, hey...

426
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:55.953
It's yours.

427
00:42:11.987 --> 00:42:14.907
Know how much
your antlers are worth to a poacher?

428
00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:17.618
I counted three points.

429
00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:20.411
Jackpot.

430
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:26.418
Thought I saw every type of mutant
half-breed critter thing out there.

431
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:31.465
I never saw a deer kid.

432
00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:43.811
You forgot this.

433
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.730
Come here!

434
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:51.569
Leave me alone!

435
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.570
The shit?

436
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.407
- Speak.
- Stay back.

437
00:42:58.951 --> 00:42:59.868
You talk?

438
00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:03.204
Shit.

439
00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:04.707
Who taught you?

440
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.919
My Pubba did, and he's gonna be
back here any minute now, so you best git!

441
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:10.879
He's bigger than you.

442
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:13.048
They don't make 'em bigger than me.

443
00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:22.975
That your old lady?

444
00:43:23.058 --> 00:43:25.561
Put that down! I don't talk to bad people!

445
00:43:26.228 --> 00:43:28.188
Them two in the field were bad.

446
00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.190
Most of them are.

447
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.152
Take it nice.

448
00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:40.951
No, no, no, no, no!

449
00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:43.537
No booms. No booms.

450
00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:49.960
You shouldn't set fires
in the daytime, little man.

451
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:54.381
Your daddy didn't teach you that?

452
00:43:58.677 --> 00:44:00.471
Saw the smoke 20 miles off.

453
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:01.764
I said go away!

454
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.269
How long you been here?

455
00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:09.772
Go back to the fire where you belong.

456
00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:42.261
God damn it.

457
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.397
What was that boom?

458
00:44:53.565 --> 00:44:54.817
It's called a gun.

459
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:57.319
Makes people disappear.

460
00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:00.072
What do you want?

461
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.574
I was thinking about turning you in...

462
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:05.536
But I'm not gonna.

463
00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:08.706
I'm an asshole,

464
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.083
but even I got limits.

465
00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:17.506
Shoo!

466
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:35.357
Hey, you put them back!
They don't belong to you!

467
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:39.153
You like those sweets so much,
you ought to plant beets.

468
00:45:40.654 --> 00:45:42.239
Mix up your sugar intake.

469
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:46.535
That should keep them off the peas.

470
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:50.330
You're using that scarecrow inside.
You want to set him out here,

471
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:51.999
reposition him every few days.

472
00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.542
Birds ain't dumb.

473
00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:56.920
You want to rotate this crop too.
Peas eat up all the nitrogen.

474
00:45:57.671 --> 00:45:59.631
Soil will be shot in a few years.

475
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:03.927
Your daddy keep a... a tarp or anything?

476
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:18.025
What killed your folks?

477
00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.569
They get the Sick?

478
00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:23.906
Told you, my Pubba's coming back
and he's gonna run you away.

479
00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:28.952
He leave you with a name?

480
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:30.746
I said go.

481
00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.875
Yeah.

482
00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:37.753
Yeah, you keep that edge, Sweet Tooth.

483
00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:39.754
Just remember,

484
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.633
good poachers don't miss.

485
00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:53.811
Where's Colorado?

486
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:54.978
Ain't close.

487
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:56.230
Which way?

488
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.696
Stay here, little man.

489
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.283
People out there hunt kids like you.

490
00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.828
Don't make it easy for them.

491
00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:14.456
There are no kids like me.
I'm the only one left.

492
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:17.960
That's what he told you?

493
00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:21.171
There are others.

494
00:47:23.757 --> 00:47:24.883
Out there.

495
00:47:29.054 --> 00:47:30.347
What's in Colorado?

496
00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.015
Nothing.

497
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:34.726
The Preserve?

498
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:38.939
My mama.

499
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:43.277
You go out there alone,

500
00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:47.030
they'll have your head
mounted to a wall by morning.

501
00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.914
So long, Sweet Tooth.

502
00:48:58.518 --> 00:49:00.312
What if he were wrong?

503
00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:05.609
